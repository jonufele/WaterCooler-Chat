## Relevant Notes

- Master moderator status will be given to the first user that joins the chat with a password.
- Moderators under edit mode: Hiding a message from the chat takes immediate effect on the other online users, while the unhide action only takes effect on user's next visit to the room.
- In case microtime function is not available, disabling the anti spam restriction may generate non unique message ids which can trouble the hide/unhide feature.
- To remove the copyright note, you must make a donation to the project (See below).
- It is recommended to rename the data directory (or move it outside the web root) to ensure user's privacy. (don't forget to rename on settings.php as well).
